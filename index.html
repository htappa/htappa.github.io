        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Henry Tappa, a seasoned Data Scientist with over 8 years of experience in the technology and renewable energy sectors. My journey in data science began with a strong foundation in statistical analysis and machine learning, which I have honed through hands-on experience in leading data-driven projects that drive business growth and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hold a Master of Science in Data Science from George Washington University, which has equipped me with the technical and analytical skills necessary to tackle complex problems. Throughout my career, I have developed a deep proficiency in Python, SQL, and R, leveraging these tools to build robust machine learning models, design and implement advanced database systems, and create insightful data visualizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            My professional experience spans various roles where I have successfully led the development of analytical frameworks, managed end-to-end machine learning projects, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to optimize processes and deliver actionable insights. I have a passion for clean energy and have worked extensively in this field, contributing to projects that support sustainable energy solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong advocate for continuous learning and mentorship, fostering growth and professional development within the teams I work with. My commitment to excellence and innovation drives me to continuously seek out new challenges and opportunities to make a meaningful impact through data science.
